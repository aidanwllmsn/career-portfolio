    longDescription:
      "For my second senior capstone project at UC Santa Cruz, I helped develop Tassel, a platform built with React, JavaScript, and Material UI that enables UC Santa Cruz alumni to connect, post, and apply for volunteer opportunities posted by UCSC students and faculty. Our project was guided by a sponsor from the UCSC Alumni Association, who connected us with key stakeholders and provided valuable insights. \n Working in a team of three developers, my primary role focused on frontend development, where I redesigned the UI and enhanced the overall user experience. However, I also contributed to backend tasks when needed. To ensure secure and efficient user authentication, we deployed and managed scalable cloud infrastructure using AWS Amplify. Additionally, I led Agile processes as the Scrum Master, facilitating sprints to keep the project on track, ensuring timely delivery, and maintaining alignment with our goals.\n While the web app is still under development, it is planned for future use by UCSC and is currently being continued by new groups of developers as their capstone projects.",

      "An AI-driven application using OpenAI API to optimize e-commerce listings for Rakuten shops.",
    longDescription:
      "In the summer of 2024, I lived in Tokyo, Japan where I interned at TENKI-JAPAN. I developed an AI-driven application using Node.js, React, CSS, and the OpenAI API to optimize e-commerce product listings on Rakuten's platform, enhancing search visibility and user engagement. To improve product discoverability, I implemented keyword optimization algorithms and leveraged OpenAI’s GPT model to analyze competitor data, generating SEO-friendly titles, descriptions, and keywords. The UI offers three optimization options, each prioritizing different aspects of the product to tailor listings accordingly. I also integrated MongoDB for real-time data storage and retrieval, allowing users to save their favorite optimized listing options to their account. Additionally, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration, high-performance functionality, and an enhanced user experience. While we were unable to conduct performance tests on the algorithm, the web app remains in development by incoming interns at the company. Due to company policies, I am unable to provide access to the web app or GitHub repository.",

    longDescription:
      "I built this photography portfolio website to showcase my work as a hobbyist photographer, providing an intuitive and personalized platform to display my nature, cityscape, and portrait photography. Developed using Node.js, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, this project was my first experience with TypeScript, allowing me to deepen my understanding of type safety and scalable development. To optimize performance, I implemented a 'load more' button, ensuring images load in chunks rather than all at once, reducing initial load time. I also introduced a categorization system, enabling users to filter photos by type for a seamless browsing experience. While the site remains simple, I plan to enhance its functionality and update the UI in the future. This project reinforced my knowledge of website performance, responsiveness, and front-end optimization, making it a valuable learning experience.",

We developed the application using Django for the backend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and React, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS for the frontend, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient data retrieval. To manage the project effectively, we implemented Agile methodologies, conducting sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives, which facilitated smooth collaboration and ensured on-time delivery. This app was never deployed officially, but the code is open source.",

    longDescription:
      "For my first personal software project, I wanted to create something related to my passion for photography. One challenge I often faced as a photographer was finding unique, lesser-known photo locations that weren’t overly popular or generic. To solve this, I developed an iOS app that allows users to share and discover photo spots by pinning locations on a map, helping photographers explore hidden gems in the LA area. I built the app using Xcode and Swift, learning both from scratch throughout the development process. While I successfully completed the app, I ultimately decided not to deploy it on the App Store due to the steep developer fees.",
